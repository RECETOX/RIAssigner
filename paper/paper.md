# Summary

RIAssigner is a software package for the computation of gas chromatographic retention indices. The package uses matchms [@Huber2020] and pandas [@reback2020pandas] for data IO and supports `.msp` as well as tabular (`.csv` & `.tsv`) input and output data formats. It supports multiple keywords identifying the retention time and retention index columns and support SI units for retention time. The retention index can be computed using the method by `@VanDenDool1963` or cubic spline interpolation using a reference list containing retention times & indices.


# Statement of need
The retention index is required to compare results from different chromatographic columns. While the retention times of one compound analyzed on different columns can differ, the retention index is only subject to very small deviations. It can therefore be used for identification of unknown target compounds alongside spectral library matching [@Strehmel2008; @Wei2014]. 

# State of the field
Even though retention index computation is contained in the most widely used GUI applications - MS-DIAL [@Tsugawa2015] and MZmine2 [@Pluskal2010] - and the Galaxy tool metaMS [@Wehrens2014] there is no standalone package which provides support for various computation methods or retention indices, such as the Kovats RI [@Kovats1958], the Fiehn RI [@Kind2009] or the virtual carbon number [@Harangi2003].
These tools are bound to consume input data in fixed formats or to only allow for RI computation and filtering inside the workflow run within the software.
